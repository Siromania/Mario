In the Mario video game series, Mario can break brick blocks by hitting them with his fist, 
or by using various power-ups, such as the Super Mushroom, Fire Flower, or Hammer suit. 
Breaking these blocks often reveals coins, power-ups, or secret passages that allow Mario to progress through the level.

Breaking brick blocks is an important gameplay mechanic in the Mario games, 
as it allows players to uncover hidden items and progress through the game. 
The ability to break blocks is also sometimes required to defeat enemies or to access certain areas of a level.

Overall, breaking brick blocks is an integral part of the Mario gaming experience, 
and it has become one of the defining characteristics of the franchise.
