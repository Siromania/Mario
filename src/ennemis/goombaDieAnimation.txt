In the Mario video game series, Goombas are common enemies that resemble brown mushrooms with legs. 
Mario can defeat Goombas by either jumping on them or by using various power-ups such as the Fire Flower or the Super Star.

When Mario jumps on a Goomba, 
the Goomba is defeated and disappears from the screen. 
This is often accompanied by a sound effect and a small animation to indicate that the enemy has been defeated. 
In some of the later games, Mario can also defeat Goombas by performing a ground pound move or by throwing objects at them.

Defeating Goombas is an important part of the gameplay in Mario games, 
as it allows players to progress through the levels and collect coins and power-ups. 
However, it is important to note that the Goombas are fictional characters and their depiction in 
the game is not meant to promote or condone violence in real life.
