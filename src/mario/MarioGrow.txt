In the Mario video game series, when Mario consumes a mushroom, he grows in size and gains more power. 
This is a common power-up in many of the Mario games and is often referred to as the "Super Mushroom." 
The Super Mushroom has become an iconic symbol of the Mario franchise and is one of the most recognizable power-ups in video game history. 
When Mario grows with a shroom, he is able to break blocks and defeat enemies that he previously could not.
