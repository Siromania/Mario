Mario can defeat enemies by jumping on them, using power-ups, or using gadgets and vehicles. 
When Mario successfully defeats an enemy, it typically disappears and sometimes drops coins or other items.

However, it's important to note that not all enemies in the Mario series can be defeated in the same way. 
Some enemies, such as Goombas or Koopa Troopas, can be defeated by jumping on them, while others, 
such as Piranha Plants or Bullet Bills, cannot be defeated by jumping alone and require the use of power-ups or other methods.

Furthermore, some enemies in the Mario series cannot be defeated at all and must be avoided or navigated around. 
For example, Boo ghosts in Super Mario Bros. cannot be defeated by jumping on them, 
and instead require Mario to use specific tactics to navigate around them.

In general, the Mario series requires the player to use a combination of jumping, 
power-ups, and other tactics to defeat enemies and overcome obstacles, 
providing a varied and challenging gameplay experience.y crafted to test the player's skills and provide a sense of satisfaction when overcome.
